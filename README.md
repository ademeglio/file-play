# File Play
This is way for me to learn how to use Java to manipulate file and directories for a future project.

## About the future project
In the future project, I am going to have to be able to do the following with directories:
  * [ ] Copy a template folder and its contents to the same drive and rename the top level folder to match specific criteria.
  * [ ] Within the folder, create a shortcut to a specific location based on the original name.
